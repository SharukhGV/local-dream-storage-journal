Everyone has dreams! This application is a digital journal built to keep track of the dreams that you had while sleeping! In the section about good dreams, bad dreams, or neutral dreams, it is totally up to User discretion to determine whether their dream was good or bad or neutral. An example of a good dream could be you wake up feeling happy and hopeful. An example of a bad dream could be waking up in a state of terror. A neutral dream could be something you dreamed about that happened in the previous day.

## SIMPLICITY & PRIVACY ##

This app was built focusing on user friendliness, simplicity, and privacy in mind. Since there is no database and everything is stored on the user's device locally, the user will not have to worry about their data being on someone else's computer. A future goals with this local app is to research forms of encryption and implement one of them. One node package that might do this is "react-secure-storage" from the site https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-secure-storage. Another goal is to allow users to download their information in the event they are upgrading their device and would need to bring their data over to their new device.

## USER STORY ##


*Here I will talk about how users can use the application.*

As a User, when I open the application, I see a home page with related information on the application's purpose. 

As a User, I can also see and hear a neat little sound bit created by the developer thought to remind the user of the categorizing of dreams in this application. The main three tones of the music is low, medium, then high, thus trying to resemble the categorization of a bad dream, a neutral dream, and a good dream. These three categorizations of dreams in this application has been inspired by the developer's cultural background.

As a User, I see different navigation links at the top of the page. Upon clicking "All Dreams", I am taken to all the dreams logged, which appears blanks before any input of dreams from the "New Form" page, found by clicking the "New Form" link at the top of the page.

## MODERN DAY Medical/Secular USE ##

*PSYCHIATRY - SIGMUND F. (Patient Psycho-Analysis through their Dreams)*

“But dreams can be used, he contends, to help a patient understand that the conflicting emotions he is currently experiencing are complicated by older, unrecognized emotions that are still meaningful, but just beyond his conscious grasp, a bit like a word at the tip of the tongue that just won't come to mind.”
